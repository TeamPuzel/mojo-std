## A temporary, unofficial std package for the MojoðŸ”¥ programming language

The intention is to provide as much functionality as possible so I have something to work with, until traits and an official implementation is avaiable for structures like proper integers and floats, lists etc.

### Tasks:

- [ ] Implement numbers
- [x] Implement a list
- [ ] Implement a string
- [ ] Improve sockets
- [ ] Implement IO
